[[__mailAfterNotification]]
=== Mail After Notification

If this notification is enabled, it will send notification emails to users who have placed orders on the store (moving forward once the notification is enabled).

This notification is tied to a scheduled task operation called *Product Reviews: Trigger 'Mail After' Emails for Reviews*.

You will need to <<_scheduledTasks,create the Mail After Task>>, and have it enabled for this notification to run. If this is not set-up, the notification queue will not clear out or run.

*Please Note:*

- Customer checks are done by checking if the customer has an account. If not, it will default by checking the billing email on the order, and compare that to emails on product reviews.
- If the customer on the order has reviewed an item already, it will not display in the email.
- If the customer on the order has no items to review, the order will be removed from the queue and the customer will not recieve an email.
- The only orders added to the queue are *Shopper* and *User* orders. Any other order source/type will be skipped.
- The *from* email acts the same way as the *Miva Template Based Emails*. If you are having issues with the mail notification settings, please contact your host.
