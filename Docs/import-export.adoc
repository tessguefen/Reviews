=== Importing

To import previous Review Data, you will need to set up the Product Review import.

. Navigate to *Data Management*
. Click on the *Import Settings* tab
. Click the *+* icon to add a new import
. For the description of the import, label it whatever you'd like (ex. *Product Reviews Import*)
. Select the import module labeled *Product Reviews*
. Click *Add*
. Click the *Import/ Export* tab
. You will now see a new import label for the product reviews import

The import will check certain fields to see if a similar review exists. This is to help prevent duplicates. The following fields are checked:

- Product Code
- Title
- Summary
- Email

If all four of these fields match a review that is already in the system, it will skip the review.

The following are the fields that can be imported:

[stripes=odd,options="header",cols="20%,15%,20%,45%"]
