== Uninstalling the Module

To uninstall the module, you will need to make sure that the *tgreviews* item and any *Scheduled Tasks* that are using the *Product Reviews* scheduled tasks are fully removed.

If you set up a *Product Review import*, you will need to delete all imports that correspond to the module.

Once these are both removed, navigate to *System Extension Settings*, and click on the *Add/Remove Modules* tab.

Find *Product Reviews* and click the *Remove* button.

The module will remove all the Email Templates once uninstalled, and remove all *Product Review* data
